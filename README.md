## F-Factor New Formulation 
## Bushfire Prediction Modelling
  
  The goal was to predict the occurance of bushfire based on the past data. There was absence of negative samples as the data contained only the records where bushfire did occur. Negative samples have been created  for eac location where bushfire did happen and filled the corresponding values for same day but different mothh and year.The model has been tested with various ratios(ratio between positive and negative samples) and various machine learning algorithms. The model is able to predict the occurance of bushfire with an accuracy  of 86%
  
  ### How to run code
  1. Download the required data from Dataset/Updated_Dataset.csv and code file according to ratio. Eg: If you want to run code where % of negative samples in the data is 50%, download thhe file Bushfire Prediction Modelling_Final_0.5.ipynb.
  2. Keep dataset and code in same directory.
  3. Run the code.
